Climate change vulnerability: Greenhouse gas emissions are projected to raise global temperatures in the coming years, with significant consequences for agriculture. Indiaâ€™s monsoon is likely to be disrupted, and yields of rice and wheat in Punjab are likely to fall substantially with temperature and rainfall changes. Monocultured cropping patterns such as paddy-wheat are especially vulnerable to climate change, and a diversified farm is a key part of climate-resilient agricultural practice. As a bonus, modifying the paddy-wheat cycle can significantly increase the carbon sequestration ability of soils, mitigating climate change while reducing water usage.
